# guessNumberGame
Little game I created with Python. The computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100 and you need to guess it (easy and hard mode available).

# Choose a level: easy or hard
This game would not be as much fun if you had unlimited attempts to guess, right? That is why, before you start guessing numbers, you will be asked to choose a level: easy or hard. The easy level will grant you 10 attempts (or lives) and the hard one, 5. Choose wisely! 

# Guessing the number
After you have selected the level, you start guessing the numbers. The computer is very kind and will give you hints after each failed guess: you will know if the number you chose was too high or too low. Use these clues to choose better the next time!

# Where can I play this game?
This game does not have a frontend, so it needs to be played in the terminal :D 

# Note
As a Python beginner, I find it beneficial to add comments throughout my code. These comments serve as helpful reminders of the steps I've taken and aid in understanding the logic behind my projects. These comments provide invaluable guidance and clarity and I decided to leave them in this project in case I need to come back to it in the future.
